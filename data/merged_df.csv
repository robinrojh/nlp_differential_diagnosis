C0002895,MEDLINEPLUS,DXP,"ANEMIA, SICKLE CELL","<h3>What is sickle cell disease (SCD)?</h3> <p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. If you have SCD, there is a problem with your hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. With SCD, the hemoglobin forms into stiff rods within the red blood cells. This changes the shape of the red blood cells. The cells are supposed to be disc-shaped, but this changes them into a crescent, or sickle, shape.</p> <p>The sickle-shaped cells are not flexible and cannot change shape easily. Many of them burst apart as they move through your blood vessels. The sickle cells usually only last 10 to 20 days, instead of the normal 90 to 120 days. Your body may have trouble making enough new cells to replace the ones that you lost. Because of this, you may not have enough red blood cells. This is a condition called <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/anemia.html"">anemia</a>, and it can make you feel tired.</p> <p>The sickle-shaped cells can also stick to vessel walls, causing a blockage that slows or stops the flow of blood. When this happens, oxygen can't reach nearby tissues. The lack of oxygen can cause attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain crises. These attacks can occur without warning. If you get one, you might need to go to the hospital for treatment.</p> <h3>What causes sickle cell disease (SCD)?</h3> <p>The cause of SCD is a defective gene, called a sickle cell gene. People with the disease are born with two sickle cell genes, one from each parent.</p> <p>If you are born with one sickle cell gene, it's called sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait are generally healthy, but they can pass the defective gene on to their children.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for sickle cell disease (SCD)?</h3> <p>In the United States, most of the people with SCD are African Americans:</p><ul> <li>About 1 in 13 African American babies is born with sickle cell trait</li> <li>About 1 in every 365 black children is born with sickle cell disease</li> </ul> <p>SCD also affects some people who come from Hispanic, southern European, Middle Eastern, or Asian Indian backgrounds.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of sickle cell disease (SCD)?</h3> <p>People with SCD start to have signs of the disease during the first year of life, usually around 5 months of age. Early symptoms of SCD may include:</p><ul> <li>Painful swelling of the hands and feet</li> <li>Fatigue or fussiness from anemia</li> <li>A yellowish color of the skin (<a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/jaundice.html"">jaundice</a>) or the whites of the eyes (icterus)</li> </ul> <p>The effects of SCD vary from person to person and can change over time. Most of the signs and symptoms of SCD are related to complications of the disease. They may include severe pain, anemia, organ damage, and infections.</p> <h3>How is sickle cell disease (SCD) diagnosed?</h3> <p>A blood test can show if you have SCD or sickle cell trait. All states now test newborns as part of their screening programs, so treatment can begin early.</p> <p>People who are thinking about having children can have the test to find out how likely it is that their children will have SCD.</p> <p>Doctors can also diagnose SCD before a baby is born. That test uses a sample of amniotic fluid (the liquid in the sac surrounding the baby) or tissue taken from the placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby).</p> <h3>What are the treatments for sickle cell disease (SCD)?</h3> <p>The only cure for SCD is <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/bonemarrowtransplantation.html"">bone marrow</a> or <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/stemcells.html"">stem cell</a> transplantation. Because these transplants are risky and can have serious side effects, they are usually only used in children with severe SCD. For the transplant to work, the bone marrow must be a close match. Usually, the best donor is a brother or sister.</p> <p>There are treatments that can help relieve symptoms, lessen complications, and prolong life:</p><ul> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/antibiotics.html"">Antibiotics</a> to try to prevent infections in younger children</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/painrelievers.html"">Pain relievers</a> for acute or chronic pain</li> <li>Hydroxyurea, a medicine that has been shown to reduce or prevent several SCD complications. It increases the amount of fetal hemoglobin in the blood. This medicine is not right for everyone; talk to your health care provider about whether you should take it. This medicine is not safe during pregnancy.</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/childhoodvaccines.html"">Childhood vaccinations</a> to prevent infections</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/bloodtransfusionanddonation.html"">Blood transfusions</a> for severe anemia. If you have had some serious complications, such as a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html"">stroke</a>, you may have transfusions to prevent more complications.</li> </ul> <p>There are other treatments for specific complications.</p> <p>To stay as healthy as possible, make sure that you get regular medical care, live a healthy lifestyle, and avoid situations that may set off a pain crisis.</p> <p class="""">NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</p>"

C0004096,MEDLINEPLUS,DXP,"ASTHMA, BRONCHIAL","<h3>What is asthma?</h3> <p>Asthma is a chronic (long-term) lung disease. It affects your airways, the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. When you have asthma, your airways can become inflamed and narrowed. This can cause wheezing, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/cough.html"">coughing</a>, and tightness in your chest. When these symptoms get worse than usual, it is called an asthma attack or flare-up.</p> <h3>What causes asthma?</h3> <p>The exact cause of asthma is unknown. Genetics and your environment likely play a role in who gets asthma.</p> <p>An asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma:</p><ul> <li>Allergic asthma is caused by allergens. Allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include <ul> <li>Dust mites</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/molds.html"">Mold</a></li> <li>Pets</li> <li>Pollen from grass, trees, and weeds</li> <li>Waste from pests such as cockroaches and mice</li> </ul> </li> <li>Nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as <ul> <li>Breathing in cold air</li> <li>Certain medicines</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/householdproducts.html"">Household chemicals</a></li> <li>Infections such as <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/commoncold.html"">colds</a> and the <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/flu.html"">flu</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/airpollution.html"">Outdoor air pollution</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/secondhandsmoke.html"">Tobacco smoke</a></li> </ul> </li> <li>Occupational asthma is caused by breathing in chemicals or industrial dusts at work</li> <li>Exercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dry</li> </ul> <p>Asthma triggers may be different for each person and can change over time.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for asthma?</h3> <p>Asthma affects people of all ages, but it often starts during childhood. Certain factors can raise your risk of having asthma:</p><ul> <li><strong>Being exposed to secondhand smoke</strong> when your mother is pregnant with you or when you are a small child</li> <li><strong>Being exposed to certain substances at work</strong>, such as chemical irritants or industrial dusts</li> <li><strong>Genetics and family history.</strong> You are more likely to have asthma if one of your parents has it, especially if it's your mother.</li> <li><strong>Race or ethnicity.</strong> Black and African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities.</li> <li><strong>Having other diseases or conditions</strong> such as <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/obesity.html"">obesity</a> and <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/allergy.html"">allergies</a></li> <li><strong>Often having viral respiratory infections</strong> as a young child</li> <li><strong>Sex.</strong> In children, asthma is more common in boys. In teens and adults, it is more common in women.</li> </ul> <h3>What are the symptoms of asthma?</h3> <p>The symptoms of asthma include:</p><ul> <li>Chest tightness</li> <li>Coughing, especially at night or early morning</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/breathingproblems.html"">Shortness of breath</a></li> <li>Wheezing, which causes a whistling sound when you breathe out</li> </ul> <p>These symptoms can range from mild to severe. You may have them every day or only once in a while.</p> <p>When you are having an asthma attack, your symptoms get much worse. The attacks may come on gradually or suddenly. Sometimes they can be life-threatening. They are more common in people who have severe asthma. If you are having asthma attacks, you may need a change in your treatment.</p> <h3>How is asthma diagnosed?</h3> <p>Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma:</p><ul> <li>Physical exam</li> <li>Medical history</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/lung-function-tests/"">Lung function tests</a>, including spirometry, to test how well your lungs work</li> <li>Tests to measure how your airways react to specific exposures. During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test.</li> <li>Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort</li> <li>Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed.</li> <li>Allergy <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/allergy-skin-test/"">skin</a> or <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/allergy-blood-test/"">blood</a> tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system.</li> </ul> <h3>What are the treatments for asthma?</h3> <p>If you have asthma, you will work with your health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. It will include:</p><ul> <li><strong>Strategies to avoid triggers.</strong> For example, if tobacco smoke is a trigger for you, you should not smoke or allow other people to smoke in your home or car.</li> <li><strong>Short-term relief medicines,</strong> also called quick-relief medicines. They help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They include an inhaler to carry with you all the time. It may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your airways.</li> <li><strong>Control medicines.</strong> You take them every day to help prevent symptoms. They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways.</li> </ul> <p>If you have a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, you will need emergency care.</p> <p>Your provider may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled.</p> <p>Sometimes asthma is severe and cannot be controlled with other treatments. If you are an adult with uncontrolled asthma, in some cases your provider might suggest bronchial thermoplasty. This is a procedure that uses heat to shrink the smooth muscle in the lungs. Shrinking the muscle reduces your airway's ability to tighten and allows you to breathe more easily. The procedure has some risks, so it's important to discuss them with your provider.</p>"

CP affects the cerebral motor cortex. This is the part of the brain that directs muscle movement. In fact, the first part of the name, cerebral, means having to do with the brain. The second part, palsy, means weakness or problems with using the muscles.</p> <h3>What are the types of cerebral palsy (CP)?</h3> <p>There are different types of CP:</p><ul> <li><strong>Spastic cerebral palsy</strong>, which is the most common type. It causes increased muscle tone, stiff muscles, and awkward movements. Sometimes it only affects one part of the body. In other cases, it can affect both arms and legs, the trunk, and the face.</li> <li><strong>Dyskinetic cerebral palsy</strong>, which causes problems controlling the movement of the hands, arms, feet, and legs. This can make it hard to sit and walk.</li> <li><strong>Ataxic cerebral palsy</strong>, which causes problems with balance and coordination.</li> <li><strong>Mixed cerebral palsy</strong>, which means that you have symptoms of more than one type.</li> </ul> <h3>What causes cerebral palsy (CP)?</h3> <p>CP is caused by abnormal development or damage to the developing brain.

So the signs can be different in each child.</p> <p>The signs usually appear in the early months of life. But sometimes there is a delay in getting a diagnosis until after age two. Infants with CP often have developmental delays. They are slow to reach developmental milestones such as learning to roll over, sit, crawl, or walk. They may also have abnormal muscle tone. They may seem floppy, or they may be stiff or rigid.</p> <p>It's important to know that children without CP can also have these signs. Contact your child's health care provider know if your child has any of these signs, so you can get a correct diagnosis.</p> <h3>How is cerebral palsy (CP) diagnosed?</h3> <p>Diagnosing CP involves several steps:</p><ul> <li><strong>Developmental monitoring</strong> (or surveillance) means tracking a child's growth and development over time. If there are any concerns about your child's development, then he or she should have a developmental screening test as soon as possible.</li> <li><strong>Developmental screening</strong> involves a giving your child a short test to check for motor, movement, or other developmental delays. If the screenings are not normal, the provider will recommend some evaluations.</li> <li><strong>Developmental and medical evaluations</strong> are done to diagnose which disorder your child has. The provider many use many tools to make the diagnosis: <ul> <li>A check of your child's motor skills, muscle tone, reflexes, and posture.</li> <li>A medical history.</li> <li>Lab tests, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/genetictesting.html"">genetic tests</a>, and/or <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/diagnosticimaging.html"">imaging tests</a>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3>What are the treatments for cerebral palsy (CP)?</h3> <p>There is no cure for CP, but treatment can improve the lives of those who have it. It is important to begin a treatment program as early as possible.</p> <p>A team of health professionals will work with you and your child to develop a treatment plan. Common treatments include:</p><ul> <li>Medicines</li> <li>Surgery</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/assistivedevices.html"">Assistive devices</a></li> <li>Physical, occupational, recreational, and speech therapy</li> </ul> <h3>Can cerebral palsy (CP) be prevented?</h3> <p>You cannot prevent the genetic problems that can cause CP. But it may be possible to manage or avoid some of the risk factors for CP. For example, making sure that pregnant women have been vaccinated could prevent certain infections that can cause CP in unborn babies.

COPD is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. The other main type of COPD is <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/emphysema.html"">emphysema</a>. Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.</p> <p>Chronic bronchitis is inflammation (swelling) and irritation of the bronchial tubes. These tubes are the airways that carry air to and from the air sacs in your lungs. The irritation of the tubes causes mucus to build up. This mucus and the swelling of the tubes make it harder for your lungs to move oxygen in and carbon dioxide out of your body.</p> <h3>What causes chronic bronchitis?</h3> <p>The cause of chronic bronchitis is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/smoking.html"">cigarette smoke</a> is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause chronic bronchitis, especially if you inhale them.</p> <p>Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to chronic bronchitis. These include <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/secondhandsmoke.html"">secondhand smoke</a>, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/airpollution.html"">air pollution</a>, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace.</p> <p>Rarely, a genetic condition called <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/alpha1antitrypsindeficiency.html"">alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency</a> can play a role in causing chronic bronchitis.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for chronic bronchitis?</h3> <p>The risk factors for chronic bronchitis include:</p><ul> <li><strong>Smoking.</strong> This the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have chronic bronchitis smoke or used to smoke.</li> <li><strong>Long-term exposure to other lung irritants</strong>, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace.</li> <li><strong>Age.</strong> Most people who have chronic bronchitis are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.</li> <li><strong>Genetics.</strong> This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get chronic bronchitis are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD.</li> </ul> <h3>What are the symptoms of chronic bronchitis?</h3> <p>At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include:</p><ul> <li>Frequent <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/cough.html"">coughing</a> or a cough that produces a lot mucus</li> <li>Wheezing</li> <li>A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe</li> <li>Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity</li> <li>Tightness in your chest</li> </ul> <p>Some people with chronic bronchitis get frequent respiratory infections such as <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/commoncold.html"">colds</a> and the <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/flu.html"">flu</a>.

However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include:</p><ul> <li><strong>Lifestyle changes</strong>, such as <ul> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/quittingsmoking.html"">Quitting smoking</a> if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat chronic bronchitis.</li> <li>Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants</li> <li>Ask your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Medicines</strong>, such as <ul> <li>Bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler.

The problems could include :</p><ul> <li>Abnormal facial features, such as a smooth ridge between the nose and upper lip</li> <li>Small head size</li> <li>Shorter-than-average height</li> <li>Low body weight</li> <li>Poor coordination</li> <li>Hyperactive behavior</li> <li>Difficulty with attention and memory</li> <li>Learning disabilities and difficulty in school</li> <li>Speech and language delays</li> <li>Intellectual disability or low IQ</li> <li>Poor reasoning and judgment skills</li> <li>Sleep and sucking problems as a baby</li> <li>Vision or hearing problems</li> <li>Problems with the heart, kidneys, or bones</li> </ul> <p>Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most serious type of FASD. People with fetal alcohol syndrome have facial abnormalities, including wide-set and narrow eyes, growth problems and nervous system abnormalities.</p> <p>Diagnosing FASD can be hard because there is no medical test, like a blood test, for it. The health care provider will make a diagnosis by looking at the <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/fetal-alcohol-spectrum-disorders-fasd-screening/"">child's signs and symptoms</a> and asking whether the mother drank alcohol during pregnancy.</p> <p>FASDs last a lifetime. There is no cure for FASDs, but treatments can help. These include medicines to help with some symptoms, medical care for health problems, behavior and education therapy, and parent training. A good treatment plan is specific to the child's problems. It should include close monitoring, follow-ups, and changes when needed.</p> <p>Certain ""protective factors"" can help reduce the effects of FASDs and help people who have them reach their full potential. They include:</p><ul> <li>Diagnosis before 6 years of age</li> <li>Loving, nurturing, and stable home environment during the school years</li> <li>Absence of violence around them</li> <li>Involvement in special education and social services</li> </ul> <p>There is no known safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy.

If it is not treated, it can last for a lifetime and cause serious health problems, including liver damage, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/cirrhosis.html"">cirrhosis</a> (scarring of the liver), <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/livercancer.html"">liver cancer</a>, and even death.</li> </ul> <h3>How is hepatitis C spread?</h3> <p>Hepatitis C spreads through contact with the blood of someone who has HCV. This contact may be through:</p><ul> <li>Sharing drug needles or other drug materials with someone who has HCV. In the United States, this is the most common way that people get hepatitis C.</li> <li>Getting an accidental stick with a needle that was used on someone who has HCV. This can happen in health care settings.</li> <li>Being tattooed or pierced with tools or inks that were not sterilized after being used on someone who has HCV</li> <li>Having contact with the blood or open sores of someone who has HCV</li> <li>Sharing personal care items that may have come in contact with another person's blood, such as razors or toothbrushes</li> <li>Being born to a mother with HCV</li> <li>Having unprotected sex with someone who has HCV</li> </ul> <p>Before 1992, hepatitis C was also commonly spread through blood transfusions and organ transplants. Since then, there has been routine testing of the U.S. blood supply for HCV. It is now very rare for someone to get HCV this way.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for hepatitis C?</h3> <p>You are more likely to get hepatitis C if you:</p><ul> <li>Have injected drugs</li> <li>Had a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/bloodtransfusionanddonation.html"">blood transfusion</a> or <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/organtransplantation.html"">organ transplant</a> before July 1992</li> <li>Have <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/hemophilia.html"">hemophilia</a> and received clotting factor before 1987</li> <li>Have been on kidney <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/dialysis.html"">dialysis</a></li> <li>Were born between 1945 and 1965</li> <li>Have abnormal liver tests or <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/liverdiseases.html"">liver disease</a></li> <li>Have been in contact with blood or infected needles at work</li> <li>Have had <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/piercingandtattoos.html"">tattoos or body piercings</a></li> <li>Have worked or lived in a prison</li> <li>Were born to a mother with hepatitis C</li> <li>Have <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/hivaids.html"">HIV/AIDS</a></li> <li>Have had more than one sex partner in the last 6 months</li> <li>Have had a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/sexuallytransmitteddiseases.html"">sexually transmitted disease</a></li> <li>Are a man who has had sex with men</li> </ul> <p>If you are at high risk for hepatitis C, your health care provider will likely recommend that you get tested for it.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?</h3> <p>Most people with hepatitis C have no symptoms. Some people with acute hepatitis C do have symptoms within 1 to 3 months after they are exposed to the virus. These symptoms may include:</p><ul> <li>Dark yellow urine</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/fatigue.html"">Fatigue</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/fever.html"">Fever</a></li> <li>Gray- or clay-colored stools</li> <li>Joint pain</li> <li>Loss of appetite</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/nauseaandvomiting.html"">Nausea and/or vomiting</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/abdominalpain.html"">Pain in your abdomen</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/jaundice.html"">Jaundice</a> (yellowish eyes and skin)</li> </ul> <p>If you have chronic hepatitis C, you probably will not have symptoms until it causes complications. This can happen decades after you were infected. For this reason, hepatitis C screening is important, even if you have no symptoms.</p> <h3>What other problems can hepatitis C cause?</h3> <p>Without treatment, hepatitis C may lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. Early diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C can prevent these complications.</p> <h3>How is hepatitis C diagnosed?</h3> <p>Health care providers diagnose hepatitis C based on your medical history, a physical exam, and blood tests.</p> <p>If you do have hepatitis C, you may need additional tests to check for liver damage. These tests may include other blood tests, an <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/sonogram/"">ultrasound</a> of the liver, and a liver <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/biopsy.html"">biopsy</a>.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for hepatitis C?</h3> <p>Treatment for hepatitis C is with antiviral medicines. They can cure the disease in most cases.</p> <p>If you have acute hepatitis C, your health care provider may wait to see if your infection becomes chronic before starting treatment.</p> <p>If your hepatitis C causes cirrhosis, you should see a doctor who specializes in liver diseases. Treatments for health problems related to cirrhosis include medicines, surgery, and other medical procedures. If your hepatitis C leads to liver failure or liver cancer, you may need a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/livertransplantation.html"">liver transplant</a>.</p> <h3>Can hepatitis C be prevented?</h3> <p>There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. But you can help protect yourself from hepatitis C infection by:</p><ul> <li>Not sharing drug needles or other drug materials</li> <li>Wearing gloves if you have to touch another person's blood or open sores</li> <li>Making sure your tattoo artist or body piercer uses sterile tools and unopened ink</li> <li>Not sharing personal items such toothbrushes, razors, or nail clippers</li> <li>Using a latex condom during sex. If your or your partner is <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/latexallergy.html"">allergic to latex</a>, you can use polyurethane condoms.</li> </ul> <p class="""">NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</p>"

It may not cause problems for many years. But as you get older, the virus may reappear as shingles.</p> <h3>Is shingles contagious?</h3> <p>Shingles is not contagious. But you can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles. If you've never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine, try to stay away from anyone who has shingles.</p> <p>If you have shingles, try to stay away from anyone who has not had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine, or anyone who might have a weak immune system.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for shingles?</h3> <p>Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for getting shingles. But this risk goes up as you get older; shingles is most common in people over age 50.</p> <p>People with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of getting shingles.

It is usually on one side of the body or face. The pain can be mild to severe.</p> <p>One to 14 days later, you will get a rash. It consists of blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days. The rash is usually a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash occurs on one side of the face.

In some cases, your provider may scrap off tissue from the rash or swab some fluid from the blisters and send the sample to a lab for testing.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for shingles?</h3> <p>There is no cure for shingles. Antiviral medicines may help to make the attack shorter and less severe. They may also help prevent PHN. The medicines are most effective if you can take them within 3 days after the rash appears. So if you think you might have shingles, contact your health care provider as soon as possible.</p> <p>Pain relievers may also help with the pain. A cool washcloth, calamine lotion, and oatmeal baths may help relieve some of the itching.</p> <h3>Can shingles be prevented?</h3> <p>There are vaccines to prevent shingles or lessen its effects. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that healthy adults 50 years and older get the Shingrix vaccine. You need two doses of the vaccine, given 2 to 6 months apart. Another vaccine, Zostavax, may be used in certain cases.</p>"

You probably need to take the medicines for 1 to 2 years. In some cases, you might need to take the medicines for several years. This is the simplest treatment, but it is often not a permanent cure.</li> <li>Beta blocker medicines, which can reduce symptoms such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. They work quickly and can help you feel better until other treatments take effect.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Radioiodine therapy</strong> is a common and effective treatment for hyperthyroidism. It involves taking radioactive iodine by mouth as a capsule or liquid. This slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormone. It does not affect other body tissues. Almost everyone who has radioactive iodine treatment later develops hypothyroidism. This is because the thyroid hormone-producing cells have been destroyed. But hypothyroidism is easier to treat and causes fewer long-term health problems than hyperthyroidism.</li> <li><strong>Surgery</strong> to remove part or most of the thyroid gland is done in rare cases. It might be an option for people with large goiters or pregnant women who cannot take antithyroid medicines. If you have all of your thyroid removed, you will need to take thyroid medicines for the rest of your life. Some people who have part of their thyroid removed also need to take medicines.</li> </ul> <p>If you have hyperthyroidism, it's important not to get too much iodine.

This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.</p> <h3>What is acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)?</h3> <p>Acute lymphocytic leukemia is a type of acute leukemia. It's also called ALL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. ""Acute"" means that it usually gets worse quickly if it's not treated. ALL is the most common type of cancer in <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/childhoodleukemia.html"">children</a>. It can also affect adults.</p> <p>In ALL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. These cells normally help your body fight infection. But in ALL, they are abnormal and cannot fight infection very well. They also crowd out the healthy cells, which can lead to infection, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/anemia.html"">anemia</a>, and easy bleeding. These abnormal cells can also spread to other parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord.</p> <h3>What causes acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)?</h3> <p>ALL happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells.

It's called that because researchers in Philadelphia discovered it. People normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell. These chromosomes contain your DNA (genetic material). In CML, part of the DNA from one chromosome moves to another chromosome. It combines with some DNA there, which creates a new gene called BCR-ABL. This gene causes your bone marrow to make an abnormal protein. This protein allows the leukemia cells to grow out of control.</p> <p>The Philadelphia chromosome isn't passed from parent to child. It happens during your lifetime. The cause is unknown.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)?</h3> <p>It is hard to predict who will get CML.

The phases are based on how much the CML has grown or spread:</p><ul> <li>Chronic phase, where less than 10% of cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells (leukemia cells). Most people are diagnosed in this phase, and many do not have symptoms. Standard treatment usually helps in this phase.</li> <li>Accelerated phase, 10% to 19% of the cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells. In this phase, people often have symptoms and standard treatment may not be as effective as in the chronic phase.</li> <li>Blastic phase, where 20% or more of the cells in the blood or bone marrow are blast cells. The blast cells have spread to other tissues and organs. If you have tiredness, fever, and an enlarged spleen during the blastic phase, it is called a blast crisis. This phase is harder to treat.</li> </ul> <h3>What are the treatments for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)?</h3> <p>There are several different treatments for CML:</p><ul> <li>Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. For CML, the drugs are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). They block tyrosine kinase, which is an enzyme that causes your bone marrow to make too many blasts.</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/cancerchemotherapy.html"">Chemotherapy</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/cancerimmunotherapy.html"">Immunotherapy</a></li> <li>High-dose chemotherapy with <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/stemcells.html"">stem cell transplant</a></li> <li>Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). DLI is a treatment that may be used after a stem cell transplant. It involves giving you an infusion (into your bloodstream) of healthy lymphocytes from the stem cell transplant donor. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell. These donor lymphocytes may kill the remaining cancer cells.</li> <li>Surgery to remove the spleen (splenectomy)</li> </ul> <p>Which treatments you get will depend on which phase you are in, your age, your overall health, and other factors.

When you breathe in, the airways bring air to the air sacs. The air sacs fill up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. If you have COPD, less air flows in and out of your airways because of one or more problems:</p><ul> <li>The airways and air sacs in your lungs become less elastic</li> <li>The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed</li> <li>The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed</li> <li>The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged</li> </ul> <h3>What are the types of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?</h3> <p>COPD includes two main types:</p><ul> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/emphysema.html"">Emphysema</a> affects the air sacs in your lungs, as well as the walls between them. They become damaged and are less elastic.</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/chronicbronchitis.html"">Chronic bronchitis</a>, in which the lining of your airways is constantly irritated and inflamed.

In the United States, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/smoking.html"">cigarette smoke</a> is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause COPD, especially if you inhale them.</p> <p>Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to COPD. These include <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/secondhandsmoke.html"">secondhand smoke</a>, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/airpollution.html"">air pollution</a>, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace.</p> <p>Rarely, a genetic condition called <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/alpha1antitrypsindeficiency.html"">alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency</a> can play a role in causing COPD.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?</h3> <p>The risk factors for COPD include:</p><ul> <li><strong>Smoking.</strong> This the main risk factor.

In the United States, this is usually a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi. It spreads to humans through the bite of an infected tick. The ticks that spread it are blacklegged ticks (or deer ticks). They are usually found in the:</p><ul> <li>Northeast</li> <li>Mid-Atlantic</li> <li>Upper Midwest</li> <li>Pacific coast, especially northern California</li> </ul> <p>These ticks can attach to any part your body. But they are often found in hard-to-see areas such as your groin, armpits, and scalp. Usually the tick must be attached to you for 36 to 48 hours or more to spread the bacterium to you.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for Lyme disease?</h3> <p>Anyone can get a tick bite. But people who spend lots of time outdoors in wooded, grassy areas are at a higher risk. This includes campers, hikers, and people who work in gardens and parks.</p> <p>Most tick bites happen in the summer months when ticks are most active and people spend more time outdoors. But you can get bitten in the warmer months of early fall, or even late winter if temperatures are unusually high. And if there is a mild winter, ticks may come out earlier than usual.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of Lyme disease?</h3> <p>Early symptoms of Lyme disease start between 3 to 30 days after an infected tick bites you. The symptoms can include:</p><ul> <li>A red rash called erythema migrans (EM). Most people with Lyme disease get this rash. It gets bigger over several days and may feel warm.

C0026267,MEDLINEPLUS,DXP,MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE SYNDROME,"<h3>What is the mitral valve?</h3> <p>The mitral valve is one of the four valves in your heart. Heart valves have flaps that open and close. The flaps make sure that blood flows in the right direction through your heart and to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats they close to stop the blood from flowing backwards.</p> <p>The mitral valve opens to let blood flow from your heart's upper left chamber to the lower left chamber. When the lower left chamber contracts (squeezes) to pump blood to your body, the mitral valve closes tightly to keep any blood from flowing backwards.</p> <h3>What is mitral valve prolapse (MVP)?</h3> <p>Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) happens when the flaps of the mitral valve become floppy and don't close tightly. In some cases, blood may leak backwards through the valve to the chamber it came from. This is called backflow, or regurgitation. When there is a lot of mitral valve backflow, the heart can't push enough blood out to the body.</p> <p>But most people who have MVP don't have any backflow. In fact, MVP doesn't cause any health problems for most people who have it.</p> <h3>Who is more likely to develop mitral valve prolapse (MVP)?</h3> <p>Anyone can have MVP. Most people who have it were born with it. MVP tends to run in families, but researchers don't know the exact cause.</p> <p>You may be more likely to develop MVP if you:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Are older.</strong> The risk of MVP increases as aging affects the valve.</li> <li><strong>Had rheumatic fever,</strong> a disease that can develop after a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/streptococcalinfections.html"">strep throat infection</a> and cause damage to the heart valves.</li> <li><strong>Were born with a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/connectivetissuedisorders.html"">connective tissue disorder</a></strong>, such as <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/marfansyndrome.html"">Marfan syndrome</a> or <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/ehlersdanlossyndrome.html"">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</a>.</li> <li><strong>Have <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/graves-disease/"">Graves' disease</a></strong>, a type of thyroid condition.</li> <li><strong>Have <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/scoliosis.html"">scoliosis</a></strong> (a side-to-side curve of the spine) or other problems with the bones of your body.</li> <li><strong>Have some types of <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/musculardystrophy.html"">muscular dystrophy</a>.</strong></li> </ul> <p>Mitral valve prolapse with backflow is most common in men and people who have <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/highbloodpressure.html"">high blood pressure</a>.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of mitral valve prolapse (MVP)?</h3> <p>Most people who have MVP don't have any symptoms.

They're most often caused by backflow. They can include:</p> <ul> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/arrhythmia.html"">Arrhythmia</a>, a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/endocarditis.html"">Endocarditis</a>, an infection in the lining of the heart and heart valves</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/heartfailure.html"">Heart failure</a></li> </ul> <h3>How is mitral valve prolapse (MVP) diagnosed?</h3> <p>Health care providers often find MVP during routine health check-ups. If you have MVP, your provider may hear a clicking sound when listening to your heart with a stethoscope. If blood flows backwards through the valve, your heart may also make a whooshing sound called a heart murmur.</p> <p>You may also need certain <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/hearthealthtests.html"">heart tests</a>. The most useful test is an echocardiogram, or echo. This is a type of<a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/sonogram/""> ultrasound</a> that uses sound waves to make a moving picture of your heart.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for mitral valve prolapse (MVP)?</h3> <p>Most people don't need any treatment for MVP. If you have symptoms with little or no backflow, you may only need medicine to relieve your discomfort.</p> <p>If the amount of backflow is significant, you may need treatment to prevent other heart problems from developing. Treatments may include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Medicines</strong> to help your heart work better.</li> <li><strong><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/heartsurgery.html"">Heart surgery</a></strong> to repair or replace a very abnormal mitral valve with backflow. The goal of surgery is to improve your symptoms and reduce your risk of developing heart failure.</li> </ul> <p>When possible, valve repair is generally preferred over replacement. That's because repairs are less likely to weaken the heart muscle, and they're less likely to cause heart infection.</p> <h3>Can mitral valve prolapse be prevented?</h3> <p>You can't prevent mitral valve prolapse. But if you have mitral valve prolapse, you can help prevent the rare but serious problems it can cause by:</p> <ul> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/dentalhealth.html"">Brushing and flossing your teeth regularly</a>.

Other names for it are Kawasaki syndrome and mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. It is a type of <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/vasculitis.html"">vasculitis</a>, which is inflammation of the blood vessels. Kawasaki disease is serious, but most children can fully recover if they are treated right away.</p> <h3>What causes Kawasaki disease?</h3> <p>Kawasaki disease happens when the immune system injures the blood vessels by mistake. Researchers do not fully know why this happens. But when it does, the blood vessels become inflamed and can narrow or close off.</p> <p>Genetics may play a role in Kawasaki disease.

Motor neurons are a type of nerve cell in the spinal cord and lower part of the brain. They control movement in your arms, legs, face, chest, throat, and tongue.</p> <p>As the motor neurons die off, your muscles start to weaken and atrophy (waste away). The muscle damage gets worse over time and can affect speaking, walking, swallowing, and breathing.</p> <h3>What are the types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and what are their symptoms?</h3> <p>There are different types of SMA. They are based on how serious the disease is and when the symptoms start:</p><ul> <li><strong>Type l</strong> is also called Werdnig-Hoffman disease or infantile-onset SMA. It is the most severe type. It is also the most common. Babies with this type usually show signs of the disease before 6 months of age. In more severe cases, the signs show up even before or just after birth (Types 0 or 1A). The babies may have trouble <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/swallowingdisorders.html"">swallowing</a> and <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/breathingproblems.html"">breathing</a> and may not move around a lot. They have chronic shortening of muscles or tendons (called contractures). They usually cannot sit up without help. Without treatment, many children with this type will die before 2 years of age.</li> <li><strong>Type ll</strong> is a moderate to severe type of SMA. It usually first noticed between 6 and 18 months of age. Most children with this type can sit without support but cannot stand or walk without help. They may also have trouble breathing. They can usually live into adolescence or young adulthood.</li> <li><strong>Type lll</strong> is also called Kugelberg-Welander disease. It is the mildest type that affects children. The signs of the disease usually show up after age 18 months. Children with this type can walk by themselves but may have trouble running, getting up from a chair, or climbing stairs. They may also have <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/scoliosis.html"">scoliosis</a> (curvature of the spine), contractures, and respiratory infections. With treatment, most children with this type will have a normal lifespan.</li> <li><strong>Type IV</strong> is rare and often mild. It usually causes symptoms after 21 years of age. The symptoms include mild to moderate leg muscle weakness, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/tremor.html"">tremors</a>, and mild breathing problems. The symptoms slowly get worse over time. People with this type of SMA have a normal lifespan.</li> </ul> <h3>What causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)?</h3> <p>Most types of SMA are caused by a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/spinal-muscular-atrophy/#causes"">change in the SMN1 gene</a>. This gene is responsible for making a protein that the motor neurons need to be healthy and to function. But when part of the SMN1 gene is missing or abnormal, there isn't enough protein for the motor neurons.

C0028768,MEDLINEPLUS,DXP,OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE NEUROSIS,"<h3>What is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?</h3> <p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/mentaldisorders.html"">mental disorder</a> in which you have thoughts (obsessions) and rituals (compulsions) over and over. They interfere with your life, but you cannot control or stop them.</p> <h3>What causes obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?</h3> <p>The cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, and your environment may play a role.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?</h3> <p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) usually begins when you are a teen or young adult. Boys often develop OCD at a younger age than girls.</p> <p>Risk factors for OCD include:</p><ul> <li><strong>Family history.</strong> People with a first-degree relative (such as a parent, sibling, or child) who has OCD are at higher risk. This is especially true if the relative developed OCD as a child or teen.</li> <li><strong>Brain structure and functioning.</strong> Imaging studies have shown that people with OCD have differences in certain parts of the brain. Researchers need to do more studies to understand the connection between the brain differences and OCD.</li><li> <br/></li><li><strong>Childhood trauma,</strong> such as <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/childabuse.html"">child abuse</a>. Some studies have found a link between trauma in childhood and OCD. More research is needed to understand this relationship better.</li> </ul> <p>In some cases, children may develop OCD or OCD symptoms following a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/streptococcalinfections.html"">streptococcal infection</a>. This is called Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS).</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?</h3> <p>People with OCD may have symptoms of obsessions, compulsions, or both:</p><ul> <li><strong>Obsessions</strong> are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/anxiety.html"">anxiety</a>. They may involve things such as <ul> <li>Fear of germs or contamination</li> <li>Fear of losing or misplacing something</li> <li>Worries about harm coming towards yourself or others</li> <li>Unwanted forbidden thoughts involving sex or religion</li> <li>Aggressive thoughts towards yourself or others</li> <li>Needing things lined up exactly or arranged in a particular, precise way</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Compulsions</strong> are behaviors that you feel like you need to do over and over to try to reduce your anxiety or stop the obsessive thoughts. Some common compulsions include <ul> <li>Excessive cleaning and/or handwashing</li> <li>Repeatedly checking on things, such as whether the door is locked or the oven is off</li> <li>Compulsive counting</li> <li>Ordering and arranging things in a particular, precise way</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Some people with OCD also have a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/tourettesyndrome.html"">Tourette syndrome</a> or another tic disorder. Tics are sudden twitches, movements, or sounds that people do repeatedly. People who have tics cannot stop their body from doing these things.</p> <h3>How is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) diagnosed?</h3> <p>The first step is to talk with your health care provider about your symptoms. Your provider should do an exam and ask you about your medical history. He or she needs to make sure that a physical problem is not causing your symptoms. If it seems to be a mental problem, your provider may refer you to a mental health specialist for <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/mental-health-screening/"">further evaluation</a> or treatment.</p> <p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can sometimes be hard to diagnose. Its symptoms are like those of other mental disorders, such as anxiety disorders. It is also possible to have both OCD and another mental disorder.</p> <p>Not everyone who has obsessions or compulsions has OCD. Your symptoms would usually be considered OCD when you:</p><ul> <li>Can't control your thoughts or behaviors, even when you know that they are excessive</li> <li>Spend at least 1 hour a day on these thoughts or behaviors</li> <li>Don't get pleasure when performing the behaviors. But doing them may briefly give you relief from the anxiety that your thoughts cause.</li> <li>Have significant problems in your daily life because of these thoughts or behaviors</li> </ul> <h3>What are the treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?</h3> <p>The main treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are cognitive behavioral therapy, medicines, or both:</p><ul> <li><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy</strong> (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy. It teaches you different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to the obsessions and compulsions. One specific type of CBT that can treat OCD is called Exposure and Response Prevention (EX/RP). EX/RP involves gradually exposing you to your fears or obsessions. You learn healthy ways to deal with the anxiety they cause. </li><li><strong>Medicines</strong> for OCD include certain types of <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/antidepressants.html"">antidepressants</a>. If those don't work for you, your provider may suggest taking some other type of psychiatric medicine.</li> </ul> <p class="""">NIH: National Institute of Mental Health </p>"

Heart failure is more likely if you also have <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/atherosclerosis.html"">hardening of the arteries</a>.</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/kidneystones.html"">Kidney stones</a>, which can happen when the excessive breakdown of the bone leads to extra calcium in the body</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/neurologicdiseases.html"">Nervous system problems</a>, since the bones can cause pressure on the brain, spinal cord, or nerves. There may also be reduced blood flow to the brain and spinal cord.</li> <li>Osteosarcoma, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/bonecancer.html"">cancer of the bone</a></li> <li>Loose teeth, if Paget's disease affects the facial bones</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/visionimpairmentandblindness.html"">Vision loss</a>, if Paget's disease in the skull affects the nerves. This is rare.</li> </ul> <h3>How is Paget's disease of bone diagnosed?</h3> <p>Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:</p><ul> <li>A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms</li> <li>A physical exam</li> <li>An <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/xrays.html"">x-ray</a> of the affected bones. Paget's disease is almost always diagnosed using x-rays.</li> <li>An <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/alkaline-phosphatase/"">alkaline phosphatase blood test</a></li> <li>A bone scan</li> </ul> <p>Sometimes the disease is found by accident when one of these tests is done for another reason.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for Paget's disease of bone?</h3> <p>To avoid complications, it is important to find and treat Paget's disease early. The treatments include:</p><ul> <li><strong>Medicines.</strong> There are several different medicines to treat Paget's disease. The most common type is bisphosphonates. They help reduce bone pain and stop or slow down the progress of the disease.</li> <li><strong>Surgery</strong> is sometimes needed for certain complications of the disease. There are surgeries to <ul> <li>Allow fractures (broken bones) to heal in a better position</li> <li>Replace joints such as the <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/kneereplacement.html"">knee</a> and <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/hipreplacement.html"">hip</a> when there is severe arthritis</li> <li>Realign a deformed bone to reduce the pain in weight-bearing joints, especially the knees</li> <li>Reduce pressure on a nerve, if enlargement of the skull or spine injuries effects the nervous system</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Diet and exercise do not treat Paget's, but they can help to keep your skeleton healthy. If you do not have kidney stones, you should make sure to get enough <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/calcium.html"">calcium</a> and <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/vitamind.html"">vitamin D</a> through your diet and supplements. Besides keeping your skeleton healthy, exercise can prevent weight gain and maintain the mobility of your joints. Talk with your health care provider before you start a new exercise program.

Each type of lice is different, and getting one type does not mean that you will get another type.</p> <p>Body lice can spread diseases, such as typhus, trench fever, and relapsing fever.</p> <h3>How do body lice spread?</h3> <p>Body lice move by crawling, because they cannot hop or fly. One way that they spread is through physical contact with a person who has body lice. They can also spread through contact with clothing, beds, bed linens, or towels that were used by a person with body lice. You cannot get lice from animals.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for body lice?</h3> <p>Body lice is most common in people who cannot bathe and wash their clothes regularly, especially if they live in crowded conditions.

PE is a serious condition that can cause:</p><ul> <li>Permanent damage to the lungs</li> <li>Low oxygen levels in your blood</li> <li>Damage to other organs in your body from not getting enough oxygen</li> </ul> <p>PE can be life-threatening, especially if a clot is large, or if there are many clots.</p> <h3>What causes a pulmonary embolism (PE)?</h3> <p>The cause is usually a blood clot in the leg called a deep vein thrombosis that breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for a pulmonary embolism (PE)?</h3> <p>Anyone can get a pulmonary embolism (PE), but certain things can raise your risk of PE:</p><ul> <li><strong>Having surgery,</strong> especially joint replacement surgery</li> <li><strong>Certain medical conditions,</strong> including</li> <ul> <li>Cancers</li> <li>Heart diseases</li> <li>Lung diseases</li> <li>A broken hip or leg bone or other trauma</li> </ul> <li><strong>Hormone-based medicines,</strong> such as <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/birthcontrol.html"">birth control pills</a> or <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/hormonereplacementtherapy.html"">hormone replacement therapy</a></li> <li><strong>Pregnancy and childbirth.</strong> The risk is highest for about six weeks after childbirth.</li> <li><strong>Not moving for long periods,</strong> such as being on bed rest, having a cast, or taking a long plane flight </li><li><strong>Age.</strong> Your risk increases as you get older, especially after age 40. </li><li><strong>Family history and genetics.</strong> Certain genetic changes that can increase your risk of blood clots and PE. </li><li><strong>Obesity</strong></li> </ul> <h3>What are the symptoms of a pulmonary embolism (PE)?</h3> <p>Half the people who have pulmonary embolism have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they can include shortness of breath, chest pain or coughing up blood. Symptoms of a blood clot include warmth, swelling, pain, tenderness and redness of the leg.</p> <h3>How is a pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosed?</h3> <p>It can be difficult to diagnose PE. To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will:</p><ul> <li>Take your medical history, including asking about your symptoms and risk factors for PE</li> <li>Do a physical exam</li> <li>Run some tests, including various<a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/diagnosticimaging.html""> imaging tests</a> and possibly some blood tests</li> </ul> <h3>What are the treatments for a pulmonary embolism (PE)?</h3> <p>If you have PE, you need medical treatment right away. The goal of treatment is to break up clots and help keep other clots from forming. Treatment options include medicines and procedures.</p> <p><strong>Medicines</strong>:</p><ul> <li><strong>Anticoagulants,</strong> or <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/bloodthinners.html"">blood thinners</a>, keep blood clots from getting larger and stop new clots from forming. You might get them as an injection, a pill, or through an I.V. (intravenous). They can cause bleeding, especially if you are taking other medicines that also thin your blood, such as aspirin.</li> <li><strong>Thrombolytics</strong> are medicines to dissolve blood clots. You may get them if you have large clots that cause severe symptoms or other serious complications. Thrombolytics can cause sudden bleeding, so they are used if your PE is serious and may be life-threatening.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Procedures</strong>:</p><ul> <li><strong>Catheter-assisted thrombus removal</strong> uses a flexible tube to reach a blood clot in your lung. Your health care provider can insert a tool in the tube to break up the clot or to deliver medicine through the tube. Usually you will get medicine to put you to sleep for this procedure.</li> <li><strong>A vena cava filter</strong> may be used in some people who cannot take blood thinners. Your health care provider inserts a filter inside a large vein called the vena cava. The filter catches blood clots before they travel to the lungs, which prevents pulmonary embolism. But the filter does not stop new blood clots from forming.</li> </ul> <h3>Can pulmonary embolism (PE) be prevented?</h3> <p>Preventing new blood clots can prevent PE. Prevention may include:</p><ul> <li>Continuing to take blood thinners. It's also important to get regular checkups with your provider, to make sure that the dosage of your medicines is working to prevent blood clots but not causing bleeding.</li> <li>Heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating, exercise, and, if you smoke, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/quittingsmoking.html"">quitting smoking</a> </li>Using compression stockings to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) <li>Moving your legs when sitting for long periods of time (such as on long trips)</li> <li>Moving around as soon as possible after surgery or being confined to a bed</li> </ul> <p class="""">NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</p>"

COPD is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. The other main type of COPD is <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/chronicbronchitis.html"">chronic bronchitis</a>. Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.</p> <p>Emphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs. Normally, these sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out.</p> <p>In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs in the lungs are damaged. This causes the air sacs to lose their shape and become floppy. The damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. This makes it harder for your lungs to move oxygen in and carbon dioxide out of your body.</p> <h3>What causes emphysema?</h3> <p>The cause of emphysema is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and the airways. In the United States, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/smoking.html"">cigarette smoke</a> is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause emphysema, especially if you inhale them.</p> <p>Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to emphysema.

Up to 75% of people who have emphysema smoke or used to smoke.</li> <li><strong>Long-term exposure to other lung irritants</strong>, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace.</li> <li><strong>Age.</strong> Most people who have emphysema are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.</li> <li><strong>Genetics.</strong> This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get emphysema are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD.</li> </ul> <h3>What are the symptoms of emphysema?</h3> <p>At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms.

However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include:</p><ul> <li><strong>Lifestyle changes</strong>, such as <ul> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/quittingsmoking.html"">Quitting smoking</a> if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat emphysema.</li> <li>Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants</li> <li>Ask your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs.

This is possible due to lower blood pressure distal to the site of narrowing and collateral circulation through the circle of Willis. Affected individuals may remain asymptomatic until the oxygen demand generated from upper extremity exercise requires a large enough compensatory volume of blood to be diverted from the vertebral artery to provoke vertebrobasilar insufficiency and its accompanying neurological sequelae. Presenting clinical signs may include pain or numbness of the affected arm (with diminished pulses and a brachial systolic blood pressure differential of greater than 20 mmHg as compared to the opposite arm), vertigo, tinnitus, dysarthria, diplopia and syncope. Notably, unlike cerebral infarction, the clinical course does not lead to chronic neurologic disability. Prognosis for recovery of normal anterograde circulation is favorable following endovascular or surgical intervention."

C0041234,MEDLINEPLUS,DXP,CHAGAS DISEASE,"<h3>What is Chagas disease?</h3> <p>Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is an illness that can cause serious heart and stomach problems. It is caused by a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/parasiticdiseases.html"">parasite</a>. Chagas disease is common in Latin America, especially in poor, rural areas. It can also be found in the United States, most often in people who were infected before they moved to the U.S.</p> <h3>What causes Chagas disease?</h3> <p>Chagas disease is caused by the <em>Trypanosoma cruzi </em> parasite. It is usually spread by infected blood-sucking bugs called triatomine bugs. They are also known as ""kissing bugs"" because they often bite people's faces. When one of these bugs bites you, it leaves behind infected waste. You can become infected if you rub the waste in your eyes or nose, the bite wound, or a cut.</p> <p>Chagas disease can also spread through contaminated food, a blood transfusion, a donated organ, or from the pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy.</p> <h3>Who is more likely to develop Chagas disease?</h3> <p>Kissing bugs can be found throughout the Americas, but they are more common in certain areas. The people who are most at risk for Chagas disease:</p><ul> <li>Live in rural areas of Latin America</li> <li>Have seen the bugs, especially in those areas</li> <li>Have stayed in a house with a thatched roof or with walls that have cracks or crevices</li> </ul> <h3>What are the symptoms of Chagas disease?</h3> <p>In the beginning, there may be no symptoms. Some people do get mild symptoms, such as:</p><ul> <li>Fever</li> <li>Fatigue</li> <li>Body aches</li> <li>Headache</li> <li>Loss of appetite</li> <li>Diarrhea</li> <li>Vomiting</li> <li>A rash</li> <li>A swollen eyelid</li> </ul> <p>These early symptoms usually go away. However, if you don't treat the infection, it stays in your body. Later, it can cause serious intestinal and heart problems such as:</p><ul> <li>An serious <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/arrhythmia.html"">arrhythmia</a> (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) that can cause sudden death</li> <li>An enlarged heart that doesn't pump blood well</li> <li>Problems with digestion and <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/bowelmovement.html"">bowel movements</a></li> <li>An increased chance of having a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html"">stroke</a></li> </ul> <h3>How is Chagas disease diagnosed?</h3> <p>To find out if you have Chagas disease, your health care provider:</p> <ul> <li>Will do a physical exam</li> <li>Will take your medical history, including asking about your symptoms and where you have lived and traveled</li> <li>Will run a blood test for Chagas disease</li> <li>May run tests to see whether the disease has affected your intestines and heart</li> </ul> <h3>What are the treatments for Chagas disease?</h3> <p>Medicines can kill the parasite, especially early on. You can also treat related problems. For example, a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/pacemakersandimplantabledefibrillators.html"">pacemaker</a> can help with some heart complications.</p> <h3>Can Chagas disease be prevented?</h3> <p>There are no vaccines or medicines to prevent Chagas disease. If you <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/travelershealth.html"">travel</a> to areas where it occurs, you are at higher risk if you sleep outdoors or are staying in poor housing conditions.

The pain is often on one side of your head. You may also have other symptoms, such as nausea and weakness. You may be sensitive to light and sound.</p> <h3>What causes migraines?</h3> <p>Researchers believe that migraine has a genetic cause. There are also a number of factors that can trigger a migraine. These factors vary from person to person, and they include:</p><ul> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/stress.html"">Stress</a></li> <li>Anxiety</li> <li>Hormonal changes in women</li> <li>Bright or flashing lights</li> <li>Loud noises</li> <li>Strong smells</li> <li>Medicines</li> <li>Too much or not enough sleep</li> <li>Sudden changes in weather or environment</li> <li>Overexertion (too much physical activity)</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/smoking.html"">Tobacco</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/caffeine.html"">Caffeine</a> or caffeine withdrawal</li> <li>Skipped meals</li> <li>Medication overuse (taking medicine for migraines too often)</li> </ul> <p>Some people have found that certain foods or ingredients can trigger headaches, especially when they are combined with other triggers. These foods and ingredients include:</p><ul> <li>Alcohol</li> <li>Chocolate</li> <li>Aged cheeses</li> <li>Monosodium glutamate (MSG)</li> <li>Some fruits and nuts</li> <li>Fermented or pickled goods</li> <li>Yeast</li> <li>Cured or processed meats</li> </ul> <h3>Who is at risk for migraines?</h3> <p>About 12% of Americans get migraines. They can affect anyone, but you are more likely to have them if you:</p><ul> <li><strong>Are a woman.</strong> Women are three times more likely than men to get migraines.</li> <li><strong>Have a family history of migraines.</strong> Most people with migraines have family members who have migraines.</li> <li><strong>Have other medical conditions,</strong> such as <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/depression.html"">depression</a>, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/anxiety.html"">anxiety</a>, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/bipolardisorder.html"">bipolar disorder</a>, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/sleepdisorders.html"">sleep disorders</a>, and <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/epilepsy.html"">epilepsy</a>.</li> </ul> <h3>What are the symptoms of migraines?</h3> <p>There are four different phases of migraines. You may not always go through every phase each time you have a migraine.:</p><ul> <li><strong>Prodome.</strong> This phase starts up to 24 hours before you get the migraine. You have early signs and symptoms, such as food cravings, unexplained mood changes, uncontrollable yawning, fluid retention, and increased urination.</li> <li><strong>Aura.</strong> If you have this phase, you might see flashing or bright lights or zig-zag lines. You may have muscle weakness or feel like you are being touched or grabbed. An aura can happen just before or during a migraine.</li> <li><strong>Headache.</strong> A migraine usually starts gradually and then becomes more severe. It typically causes throbbing or pulsing pain, which is often on one side of your head. But sometimes you can have a migraine without a headache. Other migraine symptoms may include</li> <ul> <li>Increased sensitivity to light, noise, and odors</li> <li>Nausea and vomiting</li> <li>Worsened pain when you move, cough, or sneeze</li> </ul> <li><strong>Postdrome</strong> (following the headache). You may feel exhausted, weak, and confused after a migraine. This can last up to a day.</li> </ul> <p>Migraines are more common in the morning; people often wake up with them. Some people have migraines at predictable times, such as before menstruation or on weekends following a stressful week of work.</p> <h3>How are migraines diagnosed?</h3> <p>To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will:</p><ul> <li>Take your medical history</li> <li>Ask about your symptoms</li> <li>Do a physical and neurological exam</li> </ul> <p>An important part of diagnosing migraines is to rule out other medical conditions which could be causing the symptoms. So you may also have blood tests, an <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/mriscans.html"">MRI</a> or <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/ctscans.html"">CT</a> scan, or other tests.</p> <h3>How are migraines treated?</h3> <p>There is no cure for migraines. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing additional attacks.</p> <p>There are different types of medicines to relieve symptoms. They include triptan drugs, ergotamine drugs, and <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/painrelievers.html"">pain relievers</a>. The sooner you take the medicine, the more effective it is.</p> <p>There are also other things you can do to feel better:</p><ul> <li>Resting with your eyes closed in a quiet, darkened room</li> <li>Placing a cool cloth or ice pack on your forehead</li> <li>Drinking fluids</li> </ul> <p>There are some lifestyle changes you can make to prevent migraines:</p><ul> <li>Stress management strategies, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, and biofeedback, may reduce the number and severity of migraines. Biofeedback uses electronic devices to teach you to control certain body functions, such as your heartbeat, blood pressure, and muscle tension.</li> <li>Make a log of what seems to trigger your migraines. You can learn what you need to avoid, such as certain foods and medicines. It also help you figure out what you should do, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule and eating regular meals.</li> <li>Hormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be linked to their <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/menstruation.html"">menstrual cycle</a></li> <li>If you have <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/obesity.html"">obesity</a>, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/weightcontrol.html"">losing weight</a> may also be helpful</li> </ul> <p>If you have frequent or severe migraines, you may need to take medicines to prevent further attacks. Talk with your health care provider about which drug would be right for you.</p> <p>Certain natural treatments, such as riboflavin (vitamin B2) and coenzyme Q10, may help prevent migraines. If your magnesium level is low, you can try taking magnesium. There is also an herb, butterbur, which some people take to prevent migraines. But butterbur may not be safe for long-term use. Always check with your health care provider before taking any supplements.</p> <p class="""">NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</p>"

C0152113,AIR,DXP,"CHOREA, ACUTE","WHAT: Chorea.	Chorea (Sydenham's): a neurological disorder characterized by purposeless, rapid, involuntary movements, emotional lability, and muscular weakness.	WHY:	Sydenham's chorea is seen in rheumatic fever. The chorea may be associated with other rheumatic manifestations or it may present as the sole expression of rheumatic fever.	HOW:	Typically, the onset of chorea is gradual, with irritability, uncooperativeness, fits of anger, crying, and inappropriate behavior present before the choreiform movements are noted. The movements are rapid and jerky, unlike the slower, rhythmic motion seen in athetosis. Characteristically, on raising his arms above the head, the patient turns the arms so as to oppose the backs of the hands. The patient is unable to sustain a tetanic muscular contraction. On squeezing an examiner's hand the patient can only provide a repetitive, spasmodic grip which is overly pronated and is similar to the motion of milking a cow (milk-maid's grip). The patient's facial expression alternates between frowning, grinning and grimacing. His tongue darts in and out of his mouth. His speech is slurred and vacillates between a halting and an explosive rhythm. The deep tendon reflexes tend to be pendular, i.e., when the knee jerk is elicited with the patient sitting, the leg swings back and forth four or five times like a pendulum, rather than one or two times as in a normal person. Chorea is most common prior to puberty, and in females. It is occasionally seen in adult women but never in adult men.

It causes painful, boil-like lumps that form under the skin. It often affects areas where the skin rubs together, such as your armpits and groin. The lumps become inflamed and painful. They often break open, causing <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/abscess.html"">abscesses</a> that drain fluid and pus. As the abscesses heal, they can cause <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/scars.html"">scarring</a> of the skin.</p> <h3>What causes hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)?</h3> <p>The lumps in HS form because of blockages of the hair follicles. The blocked hair follicles trap bacteria, which leads to inflammation and rupture. In most cases, the cause of the blockages is unknown. Genetics, environment, and hormonal factors may play a role. Some cases of HS are caused by changes in certain genes.</p> <p>HS is not caused by bad hygiene, and it cannot be spread to others.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)?</h3> <p>HS usually starts after puberty, usually in the teens or twenties.

C1704272,MEDLINEPLUS,DXP,"PROSTATE, HYPERTROPHY, BENIGN","<h3>What is the prostate?</h3> <p>The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder. It makes fluid that is part of semen.</p> <h3>What is an enlarged prostate (BPH)?</h3> <p>An enlarged prostate is when your prostate gland becomes larger than normal. It's also called <strong>benign prostatic hyperplasia</strong> or <strong>BPH</strong> for short. Benign means not cancer. And hyperplasia means too much cell growth. BPH isn't cancer and it doesn't increase your risk of getting <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/prostatecancer.html"">prostate cancer</a>.</p> <p>Usually, the prostate gland continues to grow during adult life. That's why BPH is the most common prostate condition in people over age 50. As the prostate gets bigger, it may press against the bladder and pinch the urethra. This can slow or block the flow of urine out of your bladder.</p> <p>Over time, the bladder muscle may become weak from trying to pass urine through a narrow urethra. When this happens, your bladder may not empty completely when you urinate. A narrowed urethra and weak bladder cause many of the <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/urineandurination.html"">urinary problems</a> you may have with BPH.</p> <h3>What causes an enlarged prostate (BPH)?</h3> <p>Researchers aren't sure why the prostate keeps growing. Some researchers think changes in <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/hormones.html"">hormones</a> with aging may cause the prostate to get bigger.</p> <h3>Who is more likely to develop BPH?</h3> <p>You're more likely to develop BPH if you:</p> <ul> <li>Are age 40 or older.
